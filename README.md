Here we host our latest research results. 

## Accounting For Global Embodied CO2 Emission

This project accounts CO2 emissions of 49 countries and regions for year 1995 to 2015, using environmental extended muilti-regional input output (EE MRIO) database [EXIOBASE](http://doi.org/10.1111/jiec.12715 ). An [interactive panel](https://yalecie.github.io/CO2) is created for dynamic data visualization. The associated publication will be available shortly.

## Resource Efficiency & Climate Change (RECC) project

The outputs of the [UN IRP project](https://cie.research.yale.edu/g7-unep-resource-efficiency-and-climate-change-recc) will be hosted [here](https://github.com/YaleCIE/RECC-public).
